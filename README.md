# ComparisonOfHarryPotter1and7
Linguistic investigation of Harry Potter books 1 and 7 - what changed?


This project (written in Perl) took the first and 7th Harry Potter book as input and compared them:
1. Which literary figures do occur most frequently?
2. What are the proportions of stop words and content words?
3. What is the type-token-ratio? I.e. How high is the vocabulary richness?
4. What are the proportions of positive and negative words? I.e. did the atmosphere change?


Results of the investigation and further information can be found in the PDF.
